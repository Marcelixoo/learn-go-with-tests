## Why unit tests and how to make them work for you

- When you refacotr your code, you are essentially trying to find ways of making it easier to understand and "fit" into your current understanding of what the system should do.
- When refactoring you must not change behaviour.
- Unit tests exercise the unit of behavior of your system. They run against the public APIs exposed by the different modules within your codebase.
- Units that are hard to test are potential areas to improve on your design.
